        <p class="text28">Training robotic machine learning models in real-world scenarios presents a host of challenges. <b>The process is slow, unfolding at the pace of real-time events. Its also costly, constrained by the number of robots that can be physically deployed. Furthermore, safety concerns and limited access to diverse environments for comprehensive training pose additional hurdles.</b>To circumvent these obstacles, researchers use simulated environments for training robotic models. This approach allows for scalability and significantly reduces costs compared to real-world training. However, this solution isn’t without its drawbacks. 

          Creating detailed simulated environments can be costly. Moreover, these environments often lack the intricate details found in the real world, leading to a disparity known as the “sim-to-real gap.” This gap results in a performance drop when models trained in simulation are deployed in the real world, as they can’t handle the complexities and nuances of their environments.

            <p>For instance, neural radiance fields (NeRF) models are generative models that can create 3D objects from 2D scenes. NeRFs make it much easier for developers to create simulated environments for training robots.</p>
            
           <p> Nvidia is leveraging generative models such as NeRFs for its Neural Reconstruction Engine. This AI system creates realistic 3D environments from videos recorded by cameras installed on cars, which can be used to train models for self-driving vehicles..</p></div>
